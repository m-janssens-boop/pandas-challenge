Analysis Summary:

District Overview:
Within the district of 15 schools, with a combined budget of roughly $26.6 million dollars, the average passing rates for math and 
reading are both above 70% (74.9% and 85.8%, respectively). 
The overall passing rate for the district is slightly lower at %65.1. 

Per School Infomration:
When you look closer at each school individually, we see that the schools that have the top five passing rates in the district (all above 90%) are charter schools, 
with much smaller student populations, roughly half that of the larger district schools. The schools that have the five lowest passing rates (between 52.9% and 53.5%) 
are all district schools, with much larger student populations. Their student populations are roughly double that of the charter schools.

When we look at school spending per captita, we see a correclation between a smaller budget per student and higher overall passing rates. 
Initially, this seems counterintuitive. As a previous math teacher, I was slightly taken aback when I read the spending summary DataFram in line 29. 
As I know well how beneficial resources are to classroom success for students.
But, when we compare the size of the school with the overall passing rates, we see a much clearer correlation between school size and overall passing rates. 
Similarly, we see a stark difference between charter schools and district schools in overall passing rates.

Conclusions:
This data suggests that small and medium schools correlate with higher passing rates in reading and math, which lead to higher overall passing rates for their students.
Additionally, it also suggests that charter schools in this district have higher passing rates than district schools do. More research and a larger data pool 
would be needed to determine if it is the charter school environment itself or the fact that the charter schools had much smaller student populations that contributed
to their higher overall passing rates.
