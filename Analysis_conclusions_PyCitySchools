Analysis Summary:

District Overview:
Within the district of 15 schools, with a combined budget of roughly $26.6 million dollars, the average passing rates for math and 
reading are both above 70% (74.9% and 85.8%, respectively). 
The overall passing rate for the district is slightly lower at %65.1. 

Per School Infomration:
When you look closer at each school individually, we see that the schools that have the top five passing rates in the district (all above 90%) are charter schools, 
with much smaller student populations, roughly half that of the larger district schools. The schools that have the five lowest passing rates (between 52.9% and 53.5%) 
are all district schools, with much larger student populations. Their student populations are roughly double that of the charter schools.



Conclusions:
